GPK is a gamemode for Garry's Mod, a Half-Life 2 modification. It allows players to interact with the Source engine in ways they never before thought possible by bringing parkour/freerunning moves into the traditional Half-Life 2 setting.

Much of the gamemode is under heavy development, but it is still playable via the [SVN repository](SettingUpSVN.md)
