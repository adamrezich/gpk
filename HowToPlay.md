# Introduction #
GPK is a gamemode with gameplay unusual to most Half-Life 2 derivatives, and thus has a rather steep learning curve. Despite this, the controls and game mechanics were designed to be as intuitive and easy-to-master as possible. Once you've learned the basics, playing GPK should feel instinctive and natural.

# Basic moves #
This section outlines the basic mechanics that some of the more complicated moves are based on. Many of these should resemble familiar first-person shooter gameplay, but pay close attention to the key differences from other games.

## Looking around ##
The first thing you'll do upon entering your first game of GPK is look around with the mouse.

## Running ##
Next, you'll want to know how to move around. Your primary means of transportation in GPK is running. It's easy; simply press **W**. You'll run in the direction you're looking at.
